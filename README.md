# Eth-Recovery-Sweeper
If your Eth (or any EVM chain) wallet's been compromised, run this it to potentially save any pending airdrops.

1. npm install
2. enter your details in their respective fields (your compromised privatekey, your compromised wallet address, your secure destination address)
3. plug in whatever EVM rpc provider
4. enjoy

*You may need to rename index.cjs to index.js. ".cjs" simply means common javascript, in my case the way my TSconfig was setup require a .cjs extension

If your wallet is currently being held hostage by a sweeper and:

a) there's currently funds in the wallet you'd like to recover
b) you're expecting a sizable airdrop in the future

It is possible to sneak around most sweepers using transactions outside the mempool. 
If you need help -> add me on Discord Handshake#2213
I ask nothing in return, and I won't ask you for your mnemonic/privatekey
